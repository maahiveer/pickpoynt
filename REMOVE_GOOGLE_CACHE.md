# How to Remove Deleted Articles from Google Search

## The Problem
Your deleted articles are still showing in Google search results because:
1. ✅ Your site is correctly returning **410 (Gone)** status codes
2. ❌ Google hasn't recrawled these URLs yet
3. ❌ Google is showing **cached/outdated** content

## Quick Solution: Force Google to Remove Cached Content

### Step 1: Use Google Search Console URL Removal Tool (FASTEST)

1. **Go to Google Search Console**
   - Visit: https://search.google.com/search-console
   - Select your property: `pickpoynt.com`

2. **Access Removals Tool**
   - Click **"Removals"** in the left sidebar
   - Click **"New Request"** button

3. **Request Removal for Each Deleted Article**
   - Example URLs to remove:
     * `https://www.pickpoynt.com/billionaire-brain-wave-reviews`
     * `https://www.pickpoynt.com/billionaire-brainwave`
     * (Add all other deleted article URLs)
   
4. **Choose Removal Type**
   - Select: **"Temporarily remove URL from Google"**
   - This will remove it **immediately** (within hours)
   - The 410 status will make it permanent

### Step 2: Request Recrawl (Optional but Recommended)

1. **In Google Search Console:**
   - Go to **"URL Inspection"** tool
   - Paste each deleted article URL
   - Click **"Request Indexing"**
   
2. **Why this helps:**
   - Google will recrawl and see the 410 status
   - Confirms content is permanently gone
   - Speeds up permanent removal

### Step 3: Submit Updated Sitemap

Your sitemap already excludes deleted articles, but you can ping Google:

1. **In Google Search Console:**
   - Go to **"Sitemaps"** section
   - Click **"Add a new sitemap"**
   - Enter: `sitemap.xml`
   - Click **"Submit"**

## Technical: What We've Done

### ✅ Created Centralized Deleted Articles System
- **File:** `lib/deleted-articles.ts`
- Contains all deleted article slugs
- Returns 410 status for deleted content
- Includes spam keyword detection

### ✅ Updated Middleware
- **File:** `middleware.ts`
- Uses new `isDeleted()` function
- Returns proper 410 headers
- Adds `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow`

### ✅ Your Sitemap Excludes Deleted Articles
- **File:** `app/sitemap.ts`
- Already filters out banned patterns

## How to Add New Deleted Articles

When you delete an article in the future:

1. **Open:** `lib/deleted-articles.ts`
2. **Add the slug** to `DELETED_ARTICLE_SLUGS` array:
   ```typescript
   export const DELETED_ARTICLE_SLUGS = [
     'billionaire-brain-wave-reviews',
     'your-new-deleted-slug', // <-- Add here
   ] as const
   ```
3. **Deploy** your changes
4. **Submit to Google Search Console** for immediate removal

## Timeline for Removal

| Method | Time to Remove | Permanence |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **Google Search Console Removal Tool** | 1-24 hours | Temporary (6 months) |
| **410 Status Code (Automatic)** | 1-4 weeks | Permanent |
| **Both Combined** | 1-24 hours (fast) → Permanent (after Google recrawl) | ✅ Best Option |

## Verification

### Check if 410 is Working:

**Method 1: Browser (Quick)**
1. Visit: `https://www.pickpoynt.com/billionaire-brain-wave-reviews`
2. You should see: "Gone - This content has been permanently removed"
3. Open DevTools → Network tab → Check status: `410`

**Method 2: Command Line**
```bash
curl -I https://www.pickpoynt.com/billionaire-brain-wave-reviews
```
Should show: `HTTP/2 410`
